      <h2>about our LIBRARY~</h2>
      <p>The State Central Library, one of the oldest and largest libraries in the country, is all set to celebrate its centenary this year.

The government plans to use this occasion to give a fillip to all State libraries. It also plans to construct a library on the lines of the Anna Centenary Library in Chennai.


After meeting 40 writers and academicians from across the State on Thursday, Minister of State for Primary and Secondary Education Kimmane Ratnakar said the government plans to launch a movement to promote libraries and inculcate the habit of reading among children. “Various writers and academicians from every district took part in the meeting on Thursday to discuss the campaign that will begin in May or June,” Mr. Ratnakar said.

Some of the prominent personalities who attended the meeting were Kannada filmmaker Nagathihalli Chandrashekhar, journalist Ravindra Reshme, and politician and writer B.T. Lalitha Naik.

Satish Kumar S. Hosamani, Director, Department of Public Libraries, said the department would send a proposal to the BBMP and BDA to construct a centenary library building.</p>
